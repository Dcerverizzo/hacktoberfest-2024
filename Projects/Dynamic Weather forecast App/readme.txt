This python code is to fetch real-time weather conditions for any city using Python, it takes the name of a city and returns the weather information for that city by scratching the web. 
So instead of using a paid API, weâ€™ll be using web scraping for this task.

For this task, I have used Beautifulsoup and the requests library in Python to extract the data directly from Google. 
The requests library comes preinstalled in the Python programming language, you need to install the Beautifulsoup library by using the pip command; 
	*pip install beautifulsoup4


You can use this logic for creating an advanced GUI application.
